[head=1]Chem for Dummies: Volume 2[/head]
[head=3][italic]by Paige Notfound[/italic][/head]

This book is written with the expectation that you already possess and have worked through the chemicals of Chems for Dummies: Volume 1. The recipes herein assume access to 3 large beakers and one empty jug for each drug. Please note though that some of the more complex recipes may require up to 5 beakers in total, but only 3 must be large beakers.

[head=2]Cryomedicine[/head]

Cryomedicine is incredibly powerful; if medical knows how to use cryo, it's about all they need.

[head=3]Cryoxadone[/head]
In a large beaker, mix:
[bullet/] 40 Oxygen
[bullet/] 5 Plasma
To make 60 [bold]Dexalin[/bold]. Use the ChemMaster to remove the plasma, then pour into a jug.
[bullet/] 60 Oxygen
[bullet/] 60 Water
Add to the jug to produce 180u of [bold]Cryoxadone[/bold]
Label: Cryo (Brute, Airloss, Toxin, Burn - <213K)

[head=3]Doxarubixadone[/head]
In a large beaker, mix:
[bullet/] 20 Oxygen
[bullet/] 5 Plasma
To make 30 [bold]Dexalin[/bold]. Use the ChemMaster to remove the plasma. Then add:
[bullet/] 30 Oxygen
[bullet/] 30 Water
To produce 90u [bold]Cryoxadone[/bold]. Pour into a jug.
In the large beaker, mix:
[bullet/] 30 Radium
[bullet/] 30 Phosphorous
[bullet/] 30 Chlorine
To make 90u of [bold]Unstable Mutagen[/bold]. Pour into the jug to make 180u of [bold]Doxarubixadone[/bold]
Label: Doxa (Genetic - <213K)

[head=3]Aloxadone[/head]
First, make 80u [bold]Sigynate[/bold] in a large beaker. The recipe is too long to recite again here, please refer to [bold]Covering The Bases[/bold]. Pour into a jug.

This recipe requires aloe leaves from botany. Grind the aloe leaves into a large beaker to produce [bold]Aloe[/bold] and [bold]Dermaline[/bold]. Remove the Dermaline in a ChemMaster. Accumulate 80 Aloe in a large beaker. Pour into the jug.

In another large beaker, combine:
[bullet/] 10 Oxygen
[bullet/] 5 Plasma

Label: Alox (Burn - Dead, <213K)

[head=3]Necrosol[/head]
This recipe requires [bold]Omnizine[/bold]. To get Omnizine, botany must provide Ambrosia Deus. You can grind Smile Extract for it, but you shouldn't. Save that desperate measure for Ambuzol Plus.

Obtain 15 Omnizine in a large beaker.

In another beaker, mix:
[bullet/] 10 Oxygen
[bullet/] 5 Plasma
To make 15 [bold]Dexalin[/bold]. Remove the Plasma in a ChemMaster.

This recipe requires Cognizine. See "Cognizine" in [bold]Non-Medical Requests[/bold] further into the book.

In a large beaker, mix:
[bullet/] 10 Oxygen
[bullet/] 5 Plasma
To make 15 [bold]Dexalin[/bold]. Use the ChemMaster to remove the plasma. Then add:

[head=2]Zombies![/head]
If zombies are called, hit the panic button to close the shutters. Chemistry is likely to be targeted first, and you need to drop everything and work fast. Romerol poisoning can be slowed with bed rest and dylovene, but actual treatment will require the blood of a zombie. Make sure medical staff are bringing you dead zombies or collecting zombie blood themselves for you.

[head=3]Ambuzol[/head]
This will treat infection, but provides no inoculation.
In a large beaker, mix:
[bullet/] 30 Hydrogen
[bullet/] 10 Nitrogen
To make 40 [bold]Ammonia[/bold]. Pour into a jug.
Next, in another large beaker mix:
[bullet/] 15 Silicon
[bullet/] 15 Nitrogen
[bullet/] 15 Potassium
To make 45 [bold]Dylovene[/bold]. Pour 40 into the jug.
Finally, in another large beaker collect:
[bullet/] 80 Zombie Blood
Pour into the jug to make 160u of [bold]Ambuzol[/bold]. 
Label: Ambu (Zombie Cure - 10u dose each)

[head=3]Ambuzol Plus[/head]
This will treat infection and inoculate against further infection. Get two jugs for this.
In a large beaker, mix:
[bullet/] 30 Hydrogen
[bullet/] 10 Nitrogen
To make 40 [bold]Ammonia[/bold]. Pour into a jug.
Next, in another large beaker mix:

Finally, in another large beaker collect:
[bullet/] 80 Zombie Blood
Pour into the jug to make 160u of [bold]Ambuzol[/bold].
Now collect as much [bold]Omnizine[/bold] as you can find. Omnizine can be obtained by grinding Ambrosia Deus or Smile Extract in a pinch.
Combine in a one-to-one ratio in a jug.
[bullet/] X Ambuzol
[bullet/] X Omnizine
To get 2X [bold]Ambuzol Plus[/bold]
Label: Ambu+ (Vaccine - 5u dose)

[head=2]Over The Counter Medicine[/head]
The feather in a chemist's cap in every shift is providing safe pills for self-medication on the public-facing counter. 

[head=3]Tricordrazine[/head]
In a large beaker, mix:
[bullet/] 20 Silicon

[head=3]Oculine[/head]
This one is easiest to obtain by just grinding carrots from botany. But if there are no carrots, it can be synthesized.
In a large beaker, mix:
[bullet/] 20 Oxygen
[bullet/] 20 Hydrogen
Heat on the hot plate to make 40 [bold]Hydroxide[/bold].
In another beaker, mix:

[head=2]Non-medical Requests[/head]
Certain chemicals are commonly requested by other departments, and so I will cover them here.

[head=3]Table Salt[/head]
Request a beaker from the chef if they come asking for table salt. In the beaker, mix:

[bullet/] 20 Oxygen
[bullet/] 10 Hydrogen
[bullet/] 10 Sulfur
To make 30 [bold]Sulfuric Acid[/bold]. Do not give them more than 30 at a time, they shouldn't need that much. The bartender may need more, and should be given multiple bottles.

[head=3]Unstable Mutagen[/head]
This is important for botany to do their job, but dangerous in the wrong hands. Only give this to a botanist.
In a large beaker, mix:
[bullet/] 30 Radium
