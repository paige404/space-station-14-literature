[head=1]Chem for Dummies: Volume 1[/head]
[head=3][italic]by Paige Notfound[/italic][/head]

This book is written such that each recipe will give you a reasonable amount of a drug to fill a jug with for distribution. The recipes assume access to 3 large beakers and one empty jug for each drug. Please note though that some of the more complex recipes may require up to 5 beakers in total, but only 3 must be large beakers.

[head=2]Startup[/head]

At the start of the shift, get these going so that medical has some chems to work with--the less they need to rely on ointments and bruise packs, the better it will be for everyone.
